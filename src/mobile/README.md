# Mobile App (Phase 4)

This folder is reserved for the new mobile app codebase (e.g., React Native, Flutter, or PWA enhancements).

## Next Steps
- Scaffold a new mobile app project (React Native/Flutter) or add mobile-specific features here.
- Integrate with the main platform backend and analytics.
