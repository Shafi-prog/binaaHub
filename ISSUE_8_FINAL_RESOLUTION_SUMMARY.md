## 🏗️ Data Flow Architecture Verified

### 1. Users Domain ✅
```
user_profiles → construction_projects → orders
     ↓                    ↓               ↓
loyalty_points      project_budget   order_items
```

### 2. Marketplace Domain ✅
```
products → cart_items → orders → order_items
    ↓          ↓         ↓         ↓
inventory  pricing   shipping  fulfillment
```

### 3. Construction Projects Domain ✅
```
construction_projects → project_orders → project_budgets
         ↓                    ↓              ↓
   project_team        material_orders   cost_tracking
```

## 🧪 End-to-End Scenarios Tested

### ✅ Registration to Purchase Flow
```
User Registration → Project Creation → Product Browsing → 
Cart Management → Order Placement → Project Budget Update → 
Loyalty Points Update
```

### ✅ Integrated Data Flow
```
Marketplace Order → Inventory Update → Project Task Creation → 
Cost Tracking → Team Notification → ERP Reports Update
```
