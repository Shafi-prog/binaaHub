üö® URGENT DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED
=====================================

PROBLEM: The error "Could not find the 'city' column of 'projects' in the schema cache" 
indicates that your remote Supabase database is missing the required columns.

üìã IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (Choose ONE):

OPTION 1: Apply Database Migration via Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
==================================================================
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://lqhopwohuddhapkhhikf.supabase.co
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor (left sidebar)
3. Copy the entire content from: URGENT_DATABASE_FIX.sql
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the migration
6. Verify success by checking the "projects" table structure

OPTION 2: Temporary Workaround (Already Applied)
==============================================
‚úÖ I've temporarily modified the API to exclude the missing columns
‚úÖ Project creation should now work with basic fields only
‚úÖ Location fields (city, region, district) will be stored in the address field for now

üìä WHAT I'VE ALREADY DONE:
========================
‚úÖ Added start_date and end_date fields to the new project form
‚úÖ Enhanced API field mapping to handle variations  
‚úÖ Created database migration script (URGENT_DATABASE_FIX.sql)
‚úÖ Applied temporary workaround to prevent column errors

üîÑ AFTER APPLYING THE DATABASE MIGRATION:
=======================================
1. Uncomment the fields in dashboard.ts (I'll show you which lines)
2. Test project creation with full location support
3. All features will work as intended

‚ö†Ô∏è  CURRENT STATUS:
==================
- Project creation: ‚úÖ Working (basic fields only)
- Manual calculator: ‚úÖ Working fully
- Location fields: ‚è≥ Pending database migration
- Date fields: ‚úÖ Working

üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTION:
====================
Apply the database migration NOW using OPTION 1 above, then let me know 
when it's complete so I can restore full functionality.

The SQL script is safe and uses IF NOT EXISTS clauses to prevent errors.
