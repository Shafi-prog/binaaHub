    // Queue for later sync
    await this.queueForSync(request);
    return this.getLocalResponse(request);
  }
}
```

### **🔄 Synchronization Engine**
```typescript
class SyncEngine {
  async startPeriodicSync(): Promise<void> {
    setInterval(async () => {
      if (navigator.onLine) {
        await this.syncPendingOperations();
        await this.downloadUpdates();
      }
    }, 30000); // Every 30 seconds
  }

  async syncPendingOperations(): Promise<void> {
    const pending = await this.getPendingOperations();
    for (const operation of pending) {
      try {
        await this.syncOperation(operation);
        await this.markAsSynced(operation.id);
      } catch (error) {
        await this.handleSyncError(operation, error);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

### **🛡️ Protecting Existing Features**
1. **Feature Flags**: Implement feature toggles for new functionality
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy new features to subset of users first
3. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to quickly disable new features
4. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing before each phase
5. **Data Backup**: Regular backups before major changes

### **🔄 Backward Compatibility**
- Maintain existing API endpoints during migration
- Gradual deprecation of old features
- User migration assistance
- Documentation updates

### **📊 Monitoring & Alerts**
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User behavior analytics
- System health dashboards

## 📚 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDES & RESOURCES

### **🎓 Phase 1 Preparation**
#### **ERPNext Integration Setup**
```bash
# ERPNext Installation (for offline POS)
git clone https://github.com/frappe/erpnext.git
cd erpnext
pip install -e .

# Custom Integration Module
frappe new-app binaa_erp_connector
```

#### **Offline Database Schema**
```sql
-- Local SQLite for offline operations
CREATE TABLE offline_transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    store_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT,
    products JSON NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    synced_at DATETIME NULL,
    sync_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sync_status ON offline_transactions(sync_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_store_date ON offline_transactions(store_id, created_at);
```

### **🎓 Phase 2 Preparation**
#### **Fleetbase Integration**
```javascript
// Delivery Service Integration
import { FleetbaseApi } from '@fleetbase/sdk';

const fleetbase = new FleetbaseApi(process.env.FLEETBASE_API_KEY);

class DeliveryIntegration {
    async createDelivery(orderData) {
        return await fleetbase.orders.create({
            pickup: orderData.store_location,
            dropoff: orderData.delivery_address,
            payload: orderData.items,
            meta: {
                order_id: orderData.id,
                customer_phone: orderData.customer.phone
            }
        });
    }
}
```
