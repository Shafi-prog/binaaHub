- **NO feature-specific plans** - Add sections to this unified plan
- **NO implementation status files** - Update progress here
- **NO architecture documents** - Document architecture here
- **NO roadmap files** - Roadmap is maintained here
- **NO summary files** - Summaries are sections in this file

**✅ ALL PREVIOUS PLANS CONSOLIDATED:**
