- **Warranties**: Connected to `warranties` table with project relationships
- **Expenses**: Connected to `construction_expenses`, `construction_categories` tables
- **Projects**: Linked through `project_id` foreign key relationships

## User Interface Features

### Modal System
- **Integration Overview Modal**: Full-screen tabbed interface for comprehensive project management
- **Order Modal**: E-commerce interface for material ordering
- **Warranty Modal**: Warranty registration and management interface  
- **Expense Modal**: Expense tracking and budget monitoring interface

### Quick Actions
Enhanced Quick Actions panel in ProjectDetailClient with buttons for:
1. **نظرة شاملة على المشروع** - Opens ProjectIntegrationTabs
2. **طلب مواد البناء** - Opens ProjectOrderComponent
3. **تسجيل ضمان** - Opens ProjectWarrantyManager
4. **إضافة مصروف** - Opens ProjectExpenseTracker
5. **تعديل المشروع** - Project editing (placeholder)
6. **الجدول الزمني** - Project timeline

### Status Management
- Comprehensive status badges for orders, warranties, and payments
- Visual indicators for warranty expiry and payment status
- Category-based color coding for expenses
- Progress tracking for budgets and spending

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React useState hooks for modal visibility control
- Component-specific state for data loading and form management
- Error handling with user-friendly notifications
- Loading states with spinner components

### Data Flow
1. **ProjectDetailClient** manages modal states and callbacks
2. **Integration components** handle their own data loading from Supabase
3. **Success callbacks** update parent state and show notifications
4. **Real-time updates** refresh data after creation/update operations

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages in Arabic
- Fallback UI states for empty data
- Loading spinners during data operations
- Validation for required fields and data integrity

## API Integration

### Supabase Queries
All components use optimized Supabase queries with:
- Proper JOIN operations for related data
- Filtered results by project_id and user authentication
- Ordered results by relevant timestamps
- Error handling for failed operations

### Authentication
- User authentication verification before data operations
- Project ownership validation
- Secure data access with row-level security

## Production Readiness

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of modal components
- Efficient data queries with minimal over-fetching
- Proper cleanup of component state
- Optimized re-renders with React best practices

### User Experience
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Arabic language support throughout
- Intuitive navigation and workflow
- Clear visual feedback for all actions

### Deployment Compatibility
- Compatible with Vercel deployment requirements
- No server-side dependencies in client components
- Proper error boundaries and fallback states
- Production-ready build configuration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. Test all modal opening/closing functionality
2. Verify data loading and creation operations
3. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
4. Validate notification system integration

### Future Enhancements
1. Add edit functionality for existing records
2. Implement bulk operations for expenses
3. Add export functionality for financial reports
4. Integrate with external payment systems
5. Add advanced filtering and search capabilities
